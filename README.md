# MovieShoppingCart

Using the Open Movie Database(OMDb) API, I created a movie shopping cart website using a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Upon opening the webpage, users will be prompted to login with a username and password with a forgot password option and a create account option. Once user has created an account or logged in, a main page will pop up with an option to add movie or checkout. When add movie is clicked, the user will be prompted to enter a movie title of their choice. A list of movies will be displayed as well as IMDb page for the movie using the OMDb API if the movie title is clicked. Users will be able to add and remove their desired movies into their shopping cart. Once user checksout, a checkout recipt will be sent to the email associated with the account.
